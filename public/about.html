      <span class="span-title">what is "segsy search!"?</span><br><br>
      
      segsy search! is an attempt at making a fast and minimal yet good-looking alternative to modern search engines. to achieve that, segsy search! does not
      use javascript at all, tries to minimize the complexity of the HTML layout and the CSS stylesheet and uses a web server fully written in C.<br><br>
      
      in this current version, the server queries DuckDuckGo to provide the web results you see. however, i plan on mixing them with results from google or even
      yandex in the future, removing repeated results and using some basic sorting and rating algorithms on the recollected entries. additionally, i am working
      on an advanced web crawler to, someday, be able to complement or even fully replace the results obtained from other sites.<br><br>
      
      <span class="span-title">how much data do you recollect from me?</span><br><br>
      
      absolutely no data is recollected. i do not log any ips or save any search queries or anything of that sort, not even for global statistics. the only
      problem is that you cannot fully know if this is actually true or not, and i fully understand that, as this is a situation i have been before. after all,
      no one is forcing you to use this search engine instead of Google or DuckDuckGo, for example, though with those you are almost guaranteed that at least
      some data is being recollected, while with segsy search!(funny name, i know) there is still a slight change that i am a somewhat nice guy that cares
      about privacy.<br><br>
      
      in fact, i have taken some time to ensure that the client never makes contact with any site other than segsy search! itself unless they click a link to
      intentionally go somewhere else. for example, fonts and stylesheets taken from external sources have been duplicated and hosted in my server to ensure
      that.<br><br>
      
      <span class="span-title">is it open source at least?</span><br><br>
      
      of course! there is a link in the main page, but here it is anyway: <a href="https://github.com/segfaultdev/search">https://github.com/segfaultdev/search</a><br><br>
      
      one thing to note: the code there is not only incredibly ugly, but also a bit slower than it should. i am working on those things, and i will try to
      slowly fix them.<br><br>
      
      <span class="span-title">but, who are you?</span><br><br>
      
      right, i forgot! i am segfaultdev(or seg, if you prefer), and i am a hobbyist developer that likes C programming and low level stuff, here is my GitHub
      profile in case you are interested: <a href="https://github.com/segfaultdev">https://github.com/segfaultdev</a><br><br>
      
      <span class="span-title">great, now <a href="/" class="span-title">take me back</a></span><br><br>
